## Schedule

This is _loose_ schedule for the one day. We will adjust as necessary based on our pace through the material.

NOTE: We will be updating the course materials throughout the class. 


## Pre-Requisites 

1. Appropriate permissions to install software on your laptop. You will need this step 6. **Liberty Mutual laptops may be locked down and you may have to work with desktop support to get the software installed**

2. Internet Access. Internet access is required to take this course.  Students must be able to access
Pivotal Web Services (PWS) at http://run.pivotal.io to perform practical work.  Outbound access to this site over TCP ports 80 (http), 443 (https), 
and 4443 (websockets) is required.

3. Installation of [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

3. For the labs, we are using [Git](https://www.git-scm.com). If you do not have git, please install it and get familiar with it [Git Lessons]( https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1 ). 

4. [Github account](https://github.com/) 

5. For the labs, you will need to have the materials cloned and track the `master`. This can be accomplished as follows:  

    $ git clone https://github.com/yjayaraman-pivotal/lm-labs.git

    Each lab has a `final` folder and an `initial` folder. You can start with the `initial` folder of lab and complete the lab with that, or the you may choose to skip a lab and just run it from the `final` folder. 

  1. If you want to avoid building app with Maven, you can use the pre-built wars/jars directly from pre-built folder in the repository

6. You will be pushing apps to the `PWS`. You should have a username and password and also [cf](https://console.run.pivotal.io/tools) installed on your machine. (This will be covered in lab 01) 

7. Installation of [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

8. Please note if you already have configuration of Maven that is configured for Liberty Mutual Proxy, you may have to be connected to Liberty Mutual Network for proper working.


## Optional (but recommended)

1. [STS](https://spring.io/tools)  

2. [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en)
